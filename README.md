# VKC - Simple Vulkan Compute framework using C++17

## Purpose

This library provides a simple way to run compute shaders using Vulkan.

## Why Vulkan ?

Because it is available almost everywhere from desktops to smartphones, tablets, raspberry pi...

## Tests

 Tests can be run with ctest. They are more like integration test than unit test so you need an actual vulkan enabled device to run them.

## Notes

 This framework is inspired by the following project: https://github.com/Glavnokoman/vuh
